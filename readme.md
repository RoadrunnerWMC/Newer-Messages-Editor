Newer Messages Editor is a program which can edit and save copies of Messages.bin from Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii.  

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Getting Started

If you're on Windows and don't care about having the bleeding-edge latest features, you can use the official installer. This is by far the easiest setup method. The installer will take care of everything for you.

If you are not on Windows or you want the very latest features, you'll need to run Newer Messages Editor from source.


### How to Run Newer Messages Editor from Source

Download and install the following:
 * Python 3.4 (or newer) - http://www.python.org
 * PyQt 5.3 (or newer) - http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
 * cx_Freeze 4.3 (or newer) (optional) - http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net

Run the following in a command prompt:  
`python3 newer_messages_editor.py`  
You can replace `python3` with the path to python.exe (including "python.exe" at the end) and `newer_messages_editor.py` with the path to newer_messages_editor.py (including "newer_messages_editor.py" at the end)
